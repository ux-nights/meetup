# UX Nights Code of Conduct

> PromptWorks expects any group using its space to have its own code of conduct. This document is only a supplemental measure.


## Purpose

The Philadelphia tech community should be open and accessible for everyone. As such, PromptWorks is committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all—regardless of gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, ethnicity, religion, or any other category protected by federal, state, or local law.

**Harassment in any form will not be tolerated.**

This code of conduct outlines expectations for participant behavior, as well as the consequences for any unacceptable behavior, in order to ensure a safe and positive community experience for everyone.

## Expected Behavior

PromptWorks expects everyone who is using its space to do so in a manner that allows for everyone to feel welcome while growing professionally. This includes the following:

* Being considerate, respectful, and collaborative
* Refraining from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech
* Being mindful of your surroundings and your fellow participants
* Alerting event organizers if you notice a dangerous situation or someone in distress

## Unacceptable Behavior

PromptWorks will not tolerate any intimidating, harassing, discriminatory, or demeaning behavior within its space. This includes:

* Offensive comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state, or local law
* Inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation
* Harassing photography or recordings
* Sustained disruptions
* Inappropriate physical contact and/or unwelcome sexual attention
* Deliberate misgendering and/or use of “dead” or rejected names
* Threats of violence or incitement of violence towards any individual
* Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated by attendees, organizers, venue staff, sponsors, or other patrons of the groups using this space. Anyone who’s asked to stop this type of behavior is expected to do so immediately.

If a participant engages in any form of unacceptable behavior as detailed above, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expelling the participant from the community without warning or refund and banning them from attending any future events in the PromptWorks space.

## If You Witness Unacceptable Behavior

If you are subjected to behavior that violates this code of conduct, observe another person being subjected to behavior that violates this code of conduct, or have any concerns, please notify an event organizer as soon as possible. It is their responsibility to help you resolve this issue.
If you are unable to report your concerns to an event organizer, you can notify PromptWorks via the ​[Incident Report Form​](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1tF9mMP7zrX0veZGy7zXEaUyGjfdLNjak2j8yokX_wfE/viewform?edit_requested=true).

If you participated in an event organized through MeetUp, you may also want to contact the organization direction by emailing abuse@meetup.com.

## For Event Organizers

Event organizers are encouraged to use their discretion when resolving issues.
If follow-up with PromptWorks is necessary, please email admin@promptworks.com.

**If anyone refuses to leave the space or is acting in a dangerous manner​**, contact the front desk at 215-985-3525, and they will be able to provide security personnel.

## Reverse “-isms”

PromptWorks prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. Event organizers should feel encouraged not to act upon people submitting the following as complaints:

* “Reverse”-ims (ex. reverse racism, reverse sexism, cisphobia)
* Someone making and enforcing personal boundaries
* “Uncongenial” tones
* Someone calling out oppressive behavior and/or beliefs
